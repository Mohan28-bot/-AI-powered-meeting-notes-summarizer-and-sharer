Weekly Product Team Meeting - January 15, 2025

Attendees: Sarah Chen (Product Manager), Mike Rodriguez (Engineering Lead), Lisa Wang (UX Designer), John Smith (Marketing Director)

Meeting started at 2:00 PM

Sarah: Let's review our Q1 roadmap. We have three major features to deliver: user authentication system, advanced search functionality, and mobile app optimization.

Mike: The authentication system is progressing well. We've completed the backend API and are now working on the frontend integration. Should be ready for testing by January 25th. However, we're facing some challenges with the OAuth implementation for Google and Facebook login.

Lisa: I've finished the wireframes for the advanced search feature. The user testing sessions showed positive feedback, but users want more filtering options. I recommend adding date range filters and category tags.

John: From a marketing perspective, the mobile optimization is our highest priority. Our analytics show 65% of users access the platform via mobile devices, but our conversion rate on mobile is 40% lower than desktop.

Sarah: Good point, John. Let's prioritize the mobile optimization. Mike, can your team shift resources to focus on this first?

Mike: Yes, we can reallocate two developers to mobile optimization. This might delay the authentication system by one week, pushing it to February 1st.

Lisa: I can provide the mobile design specifications by January 20th. The main issues are page load times and touch interface improvements.

John: I'll coordinate with the content team to prepare mobile-specific marketing campaigns. We should also A/B test the new mobile interface before full rollout.

Action Items:
1. Mike: Reallocate developers to mobile optimization (Due: January 18th)
2. Lisa: Deliver mobile design specifications (Due: January 20th)
3. John: Prepare mobile marketing campaigns (Due: January 25th)
4. Sarah: Schedule user testing session for mobile optimization (Due: January 22nd)
5. Mike: Resolve OAuth implementation issues for authentication system (Due: January 30th)

Next meeting: January 22nd, 2:00 PM
